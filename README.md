# wrestleform
Wrestleform is an application that will generate prediction questionnaires based on upcoming professional wrestling programs.

Besides generating wrestling forms, this application exists to provide example code that I can reference in upcoming blogs and similar educational concepts. If you find interesting examples to blog about, you're welcome to reference this too!
